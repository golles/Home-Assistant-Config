  description: |
    This automation does update a car location.
    Requirements:
      - An iPhone
      - Focus while driving should be set, either automatically or via Bluetooth.
      - Shortcuts app should be installed and 2 automations should be created:
        1. When focus Driving is turned on -> select Home Assistant event: GOLF_75_START
        2. When focus Driving is turned off -> select Home Assistant event: GOLF_75_STOP
    Every minute the location of the person who sent the start event is used as the car location. This is done until the stop event is sent.
    This does only work if a defined Home Assistant person is driving the car, so no theft protection.
  mode: restart
  trigger:
    - platform: event
      event_type: GOLF_75_START
      id: start
    - platform: event
      event_type: GOLF_75_STOP
      id: stop
  variables:
    device_tracker_id: golf_7_5
    throttle_seconds: 60
  action:
    - alias: Collect some variables
      variables:
        user_id: "{{ trigger.event.context.user_id }}"

          {{ 
            states.person 
              | selectattr("attributes.user_id", "eq", user_id)
              | map(attribute="entity_id")
              | first
              | default("none")
          }}
